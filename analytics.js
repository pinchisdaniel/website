// This site is a static HTML site. The `@vercel/analytics` package is a Node/npm
// package that needs bundling (e.g. with Webpack/Rollup/Vite) to be imported
// with a bare specifier like `@vercel/analytics` in the browser.
//
// For static sites deployed to Vercel, use the lightweight Vercel Insights
// snippet instead. Add this to your <head> in `index.html` and replace the
// domain with the one configured in your Vercel project:
//
// <script defer data-domain="your-domain.com" src="https://static.vercel-insights.com/script.js"></script>
//
// If you prefer to use the npm package, set up a bundler that resolves
// `@vercel/analytics` and imports this file as a module during a build step.
// For now the site includes the Insights script directly in `index.html`.
